                <h3>Design & Development</h3>
                <p>I started learning computers at the age of 14 in early high school, languages: Pascal, c, c #, java and other tools in computer studies. Very quickly I felt I belonged in dealing with computer languages and writing code and from there everything is history.</p>

                <h3>Play Gitar</h3>
                <p>I played guitar for many years mostly songs in Russian, but unfortunately I had not played for years, so my little brother asked the guitar for himself to try, so I gave it to him. I still dream one day of going back to that.</p>
